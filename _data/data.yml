        Develop a search engine for similar meteorological phenomena based on satellite videos from the past 40 years. This project involves developing a model for embedding large-scale satellite videos and constructing a K-nearest neighbor graph. Consequently, it aims to reduce the effort of the weather forecasters in the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA).
